      <h1>Welcome to the Chuck Norris Quote's App</h1>
      <p>
        The 'facts' are normally absurd hyperbolic claims about Norris'
        toughness, attitude, virility, sophistication, and masculinity.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you first start you will receive a random fact, or you could also
        choose your own category.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can choose: animal, career, celebrity, dev, explicit, fashion, food,
        history, money, movie, music, political, religion, science, sport,
        travel
      </p>
      <h2>Have Fun!</h2>
    </div>
